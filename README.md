# Detective
This is a game that I am working on but I currently lack the artistic talent needed for the game.

# Open Call for Talent
I have a lot of projects in my mind, and I am actively looking for a team. Currently, I want an artist, but any interested parties may apply. I will showcase which projects are on the pot (Demos and/or GDDs) should you be interested in partnering-up with me. For further queries, email me at: ali.usman.awan.personal@gmail.com
